# Blockchain Voting System

A simple blockchain-based voting system implemented in Python. This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to securely record votes, prevent double voting, and transparently display election results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **SHA-256 Hashing** (via `hashlib`)
- **Proof-of-Work Mining**
- **Blockchain Data Structure**

## Features

- Register voters and candidates
- Cast votes securely
- Prevent double voting
- Mine votes into blocks using proof-of-work
- Validate blockchain integrity
- Display election results and blockchain info

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-voting.git
   cd blockchain-voting
   ```

2. **Run the voting system**  
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
   ```sh
   python blockchain_voting.py
   ```

3. **See the output**  
   The program will register voters, add candidates, start voting, cast votes, stop voting, and display results and blockchain details in your terminal.
